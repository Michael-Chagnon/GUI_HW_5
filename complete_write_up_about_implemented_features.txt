	For this assignment I was able to implement almost all desired features. Tiles are selected randomly using a data structure provided by Ramon Meza. The tiles are draggable and can be dropped onto appropriate droppable elements. The program is able to identify which letter tile is inside of which droppable after it has been dropped inside. The only exception is for the rack when tiles are initially created, instead tiles float on top of the appropriate divs. The board does have two bonus squares and they do both tally up the score correctly. The game can be played until there are less than 7 tiles left in the bag, at that point the user is then alerted of this. The board clears after each round and counts score and gives the player the appropriate amount of tiles in their rack to bring them back to 7. Score for the game is kept across multiple words until a new game is started. Tiles can move back and forth from the board to the rack, tiles will also go back to the last droppable they were placed in if dropped in an invalid place. I was unable to get all subsequent letter to be placed directly next to another letter with no space. Lastly the user is able to restart the game at any time.
